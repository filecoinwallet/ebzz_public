#### Getting Started with EBZZ 

Now we’ll connect to this blockchain from elsewhere. On the second server, run the following:

`ebzz bzz@[ip]:[port]`

You should be told that the blockchain was successfully initialized, but you do not have permission to connect. You should also be shown a message containing an address in this node’s wallet.



### Now that the blockchain is working on two nodes, you can run the commands in this section on either or both. To get general information:

#### bzz_getinfo

See a list of all available commands:

#### bzz_help

Show all permissions currently assigned:

#### bzz_listpermissions

List the addresses in the wallet:

#### bzz_listaddresses

For each node, get a list of connected peers:

#### bzz_getpeerinfo

If you are using EBZZ Enterprise, you should see that the connection between the peers is encrypted.
